**TypeScript**
* Superset of Javascript.
* Strong typing, you define types. It allows you to write much robust code, which gets checked at time of writing.
* in vanilla JS, its dynamic typing. 
* More features than vanilla JS( e.g Types, Classes,Interfaces..)
* Typescript does not run n browser. We need to complile into javascript. We need CLI.
* Angular apps can be written into javascript, but it will no much fun.
