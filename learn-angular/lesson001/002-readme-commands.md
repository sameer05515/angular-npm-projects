============
Angular is for static and some dynamic html content (dynamic binding)

==============
index.html --- script declarations are dynamically injected by angular.

==============
[{ngModule}]  -- this is directive

===================
Angular is split up into multiple modules,subpackages. we need to add them if you want to use certain feature you need.

subpackages to be added in app.module.ts

## What you should know before learning Angular ##

* Javascript Fundamentals (Objects, Arrays, Conditionals,etc)

**It may help to learn these first**
* TypeScript
* Classes
* High Order Array Methods - ForEach, map, filter
* Arrow Functions
* Promises & Observables
* MVC Pattern

======================================

## The Angular way ##
* Uses Typescript for static types (variables, functions, params)
* Component based (Like other frameworks)
* Uses "services" to share data/functionality between components
* Concept of "modules" (root module, forms module, http module, etc)
* Uses RxJS "Observables" for async operations
* Steep learning curve relative to other frameworks
